## Introduction
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

## How to play
To run this program, you will need Matlab. If you don't have Matlab, you can use [Octave](https://octave-online.net).
1. First you will have to upload all the `.m` files from this repo, in your project. In Octave, in order to upload files, you will have to sign in.
2. Run the command in console:
    1. If you want to play in **romanian** the command is `joc()`. Send it and follow the instructions.
    2. The same goes for **english** but the command is `startGame()`.
